The “face” class is which is in the “final_gui” file contains the code for the interface (the section at the bottom of the drawing screen that displays the different colors and sizes), menus, and buttons. The code responsible for drawing the lines, creating the levels of mirroring, undoing and redoing drawings, clearing the whole drawing, saving and loading drawings, and pausing and unpausing music is also located in the “final_gui” file. This wasn’t originally the setup of the coding but we found it to work out better for us that way. Robert was responsible for creating the code to get the lines to draw, as well as the mirroring function, and all the keyboard functions. Isai was responsible for creating the interface, guis, and buttons.
