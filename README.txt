This program allows you to create your very own artwork by manipulating the number of mirroring lines, also being able to change the color and the width of those lines. 

Key Functions:

z = undo
y = redo
c = clear drawing
w = increase mirroring
s = decrease mirroring
k = save work
l = load work
p = pause music
u = unpause music

Mouse functions:

- after pressing start, click and hold mouse while moving it to draw lines
- after clicking on moving coin to bring up options menu, clicking on a color changes the drawing color, and clicking on a size changes the width of the drawing line 


Note: The music takes a few seconds to hear if your volume isn’t pretty high initially. The noise level picks up automatically shortly after the program is opened, so you don’t have to raise your volume high.
